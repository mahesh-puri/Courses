title: "Kubernetes Mastery"
description: "Operating containerized applications at scale."
---

Kubernetes is **not just YAML** — it is a distributed systems platform for
running containerized workloads reliably at scale.

This course focuses on **how Kubernetes behaves**, why it exists, and how to
reason about it operationally — especially if you already understand Docker.

---

## 🎯 Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand Kubernetes core primitives and their responsibilities
- Reason about scheduling, scaling, and self-healing
- Debug real-world Kubernetes issues methodically
- Connect Docker mental models to Kubernetes abstractions

---

## 📘 Modules _(Planned)_

### 1️⃣ Kubernetes Architecture & Mental Model

- Why Kubernetes exists
- Control plane vs worker nodes
- API server, scheduler, controller manager
- Declarative desired state

---

### 2️⃣ Pods & Workloads

- Pods and containers
- Deployments, ReplicaSets, Jobs, CronJobs
- Rolling updates and restarts
- Restart and failure behavior

---

### 3️⃣ Networking & Services

- Cluster networking basics
- Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- DNS inside the cluster
- Ingress and traffic flow (high level)

---

### 4️⃣ Configuration & Secrets

- ConfigMaps vs Secrets
- Environment variables vs mounted files
- Configuration patterns that scale

---

### 5️⃣ Storage & Persistence

- Volumes in Kubernetes
- PersistentVolumes and PVCs
- Stateful workloads basics

---

### 6️⃣ Scaling & Reliability

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- Resource requests and limits
- Readiness vs liveness probes
- Self-healing behavior

---

### 7️⃣ Debugging & Operations

- Inspecting Pods and workloads
- Logs and exec
- Common failure modes
- Mapping Docker debugging skills to Kubernetes
