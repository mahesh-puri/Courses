# ⚙️ DevOps & Cloud

DevOps is about **owning software beyond writing code**.

This track focuses on how applications behave **after they leave your laptop**:
how they run, how they fail, how they scale, and how they are operated in real
production environments.

You’ll build strong mental models around:

- How applications are packaged and deployed
- How infrastructure and runtime concerns affect reliability
- How modern DevOps practices reduce risk and increase velocity
