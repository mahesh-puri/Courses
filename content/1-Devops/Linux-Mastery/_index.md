# 🐧 Linux Mastery

Linux is the **foundation of modern DevOps, cloud platforms, and containers**.
If you run software in production, Linux is always part of the picture — whether
you see it directly or not.

This course is designed to build **practical Linux fluency** for developers and
DevOps engineers, focusing on how Linux behaves in real systems rather than
memorizing commands in isolation.

---

## 🎯 Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Navigate Linux systems confidently
- Understand how processes, files, and permissions really work
- Debug common system-level issues
- Reason about Linux behavior inside containers and cloud VMs
