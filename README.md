# Engineering Courses & Learning Notes - A Reference Guide

This repository contains a growing collection of structured technical courses
covering **frontend development, backend systems, DevOps, and cloud-native
engineering**, with planned expansion into **AI and applied machine learning**.

The goal of this repository is to provide **clear, practical, and concept-driven**
learning material that reflects how modern software systems are actually built,
deployed, and operated in real engineering environments.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Most learning resources focus on *what commands to run* or *which buttons to
click*. This repository focuses on:

- Mental models and first-principles understanding
- Real-world behavior, not idealized demos
- Operational trade-offs and design decisions
- Debugging and failure-mode thinking
- Practical workflows used in production systems

The intent is to help engineers understand **why things work the way they do**,
so tools and frameworks feel predictable instead of magical.

## 📚 Course Structure

Each course is organized as a guided learning path made up of focused modules.
Courses can be read:

- **Sequentially**, as a structured learning track  
- **Individually**, as standalone reference material  

All content is authored in Markdown and published using **Quartz**, enabling a
fast, searchable, and maintainable documentation-style website.

## 🧭 Planned Areas

This repository is intended to grow over time, with courses planned in:

- **Frontend Engineering** (architecture, performance, tooling)
- **Backend Engineering** (services, APIs, data, scalability)
- **DevOps & Cloud** (CI/CD, Kubernetes, infrastructure)
- **AI & Applied ML** (system integration, practical usage)

## 🛠️ How the Content Is Built

- Written in Markdown
- Built and published using Quartz
- Deployed as a static site via GitHub Pages
- Designed for long-term maintainability and clarity

---

## 📖 Usage

You are free to read, reference, and learn from the material. The content is
designed to be practical, opinionated where necessary, and continuously refined
as tools and practices evolve.
